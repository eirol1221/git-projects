# 🍕Hello World NFT

## **🚀 Creating an Elon Musk NFT locally**

In the contracts folder, create a new file named Elon.sol. This is your new contract file.

```
/ SPDX-License-Identifier: UNLICENSED
 
pragma solidity ^0.8.0; //this is the version of the solidity we are using in this contract.
 
import "hardhat/console.sol"; //this is given to us by hardhat to debug our code. It is very helpful in local environment.
 
contract ElonNFT { 
 
    //this is our NFT contract and it has a constructor. As soon as the contract is deployed, the constructor is called and we will see a message on 
    //terminal. All thanks to the console log. 
 
    constructor() {
        console.log("This is my Elon Musk NFT contract!!");
    }
}
```

I have explained everything in the comments above. Now let's edit our scripts file to call this a contract. Also, you should know that for every contract you write, you must create a different contract file. This is the general convention used, it makes easy to manage the code and avoid coding mishaps!

First things first, I will rename the sample-script.js file to run.js and then I will make some changes to the file. You can go ahead and copy them.

```
const hre = require("hardhat");
 
async function main() {
  // We get the contract to deploy
  const ElonNFT = await hre.ethers.getContractFactory("ElonNFT");
  const elon = await ElonNFT.deploy();
 
  await elon.deployed();
 
  console.log("ElonNFT deployed to:", elon.address);
}
 
// We recommend this pattern to be able to use async/await everywhere
// and properly handle errors.
main()
  .then(() => process.exit(0))
  .catch((error) => {
    console.error(error);
    process.exit(1);
  });
```

The above code is almost same as our Greeter script. But I have made some changes. Now I am calling it ElonNFT which is our contract name and then deploying it. Once the contract is deployed, we will see the constructor message on screen and the address where the contract is deployed to.
