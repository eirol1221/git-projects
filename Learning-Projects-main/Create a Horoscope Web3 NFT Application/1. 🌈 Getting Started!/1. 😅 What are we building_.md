# 🌈 Getting Started!

## **😅 What are we building?**

Heya folks! I am Fama and today I will be helping you create your first ever Web3 application and ship it too.

This is a very cool and exciting project. We will create a react app that takes a users’ date of birth, connects their metamask account and then mints an NFT to their address.

This will be a pure example of how an application can interact with a deployed contract. Using this, you can create some engaging apps too. For example:

1.  A Harry Potter quiz app that tells you which Hogwartz House you belong to?
2.  A quiz app to see if you are BTS Army or not? (I love BTS!! 🔥)
3.  The famous 13 personality test

For you the sky is the limit. Once you have created this react app, you can come up with unique and fun app ideas, launch them and get users to try your app. This is gonna be so cool and I am already excited to see what dope projects you create.

Not only this, there is much more fun stuff we will be doing during this project. So be excited and please bring your A game here.

We will:

1.  Cover some super cool tools that you need to interact with as a smart contract developer.
2.  Create your first ever Web3 application.
3.  Mint an NFT
4.  Interact with a deployed contract.
5.  Learn how to connect MetaMask to a Website.
6.  Ship it to testnet and thennnn, interact with it too. 🔥🔥

Please install VScode and node on your machine. Install  [node from here](https://nodejs.org/en/). Download  [VScode](https://code.visualstudio.com/)  from here.

If you complete this course with me today, you will be getting a special NFT, a utility token, which will unlock many more opportunities for you on the Metaschool platform. Here is how the NFT looks like.
