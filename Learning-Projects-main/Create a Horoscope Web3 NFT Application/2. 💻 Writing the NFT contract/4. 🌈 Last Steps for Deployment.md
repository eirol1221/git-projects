# 💻 Writing the NFT contract

## **🌈 Last Steps for Deployment**

First let’s do some basic housekeeping stuff. We know that there are massive scams and security issues happening in the crypto world. You make a mistake and it can cost you a life time.

While writing and deploying your contract you sign off each contract with your private key to tell the blockchain that you are a legit person creating a real transaction. Now if that private key is made visible, the hacker can gain access to your account and then the rest will be history. In order to avoid this issue. Let’s do the following.

```
npm install dotenv --save
touch .gitignore
```

Now go ahead and create  **.env file**  at the base of your project. Open your .gitignore file and write .env there.

All the secrets and important keys related to your project will be stored in .env file and we can access this data whenever and wherever. In the gitignore file we simply write .env, it tells git to ignore that file from future commits.

Open the .env file you have just created. Add your MetaMask Private Key and Alchemy App HTTP URL there. Should be something like this.

```
PRIVATE_KEY = YOUR-PRIVATE-KEY
API_URL_KEY = YOUR-ALCHEMY-APP-URL
API_KEY = YOUR-ALCHEMY-APP-KEY
```

We will update our hardhat config file to setup Rinkeby Deployment.

#### Updating Hardhat Config file

Open your hardhat.config.js file and paste the following code.

```
/**
 * @type import('hardhat/config').HardhatUserConfig
 */
require('dotenv').config(); //all the key value pairs are being made available due to this lib
require('@nomiclabs/hardhat-ethers');
 
const {API_URL_KEY, PRIVATE_KEY} = process.env; //environment variables are being loaded here.
 
module.exports = {
  solidity: "0.8.1",
  defaultNetwork: 'rinkeby',
  networks: {
    hardhat: {},
    rinkeby: {
        url: API_URL_KEY,
        accounts: [`0x${PRIVATE_KEY}`]
    }
  }
};
```

### Deployment

Now you are ready to deploy your contract to Rinkeby Network. The command is almost same as before but now you will mention the rinkeby network where you are deploying your contract.

Wait a second. We need to update our  **deploy.js file too.**

```
const hre = require("hardhat"); 
 
async function main() {  
 
    const horoscopeNFT = await hre.ethers.getContractFactory("horoscopeNFT");
    const hscp = await horoscopeNFT.deploy();   
    await hscp.deployed();
 
    //since we are testing, you should mention your own Eth wallet address
    const myAddress="ETHEREUM-ADDRESS-WHERE-YOU-WANT-TO-MINT";
    console.log("horoscopeNFT deployed to:", hscp.address);   
 
    let txn = await hscp.mintNFT(myAddress, 'virgo');
    await txn.wait();
 
 } 
 
main()
    .then(() => process.exit(0))  
    .catch((error) => {    
    console.error(error);
    process.exit(1); 
 });
```

This is what we are doing in our deployment script. By using Hardhat ethers plugin, we create an instance of our contract and deploy it.

```
const horoscopeNFT = await hre.ethers.getContractFactory("horoscopeNFT");
const hscp = await horoscopeNFT.deploy();   
await hscp.deployed();
```

Once the contract is deployed. We call the mintNFT function by passing it an address and a string ‘virgo’ horoscope sign to call the mint function.

```
let txn = await hscp.mintNFT(myAddress, 'virgo');
await txn.wait();
```

Let’s run the command in our terminal and run this project.

```
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network rinkeby
```

Once your contract is deployed. You can do the following things.

Copy your contract address and scan it on  [Rinkeby Ethercan](https://rinkeby.etherscan.io/). The contract address must have appeared on terminal because of console log. You will also be able to see that the mint function is called.

Copy the contract address and open  [testnets.opensea.io](http://testnets.opensea.io/). You will be able to see your collection, and one NFT minted there.

Just like etherscan, there is a  [rinkeby.etherscan.io](https://rinkeby.etherscan.io/). This is to help you track your smart contracts and transaction. You can open rinkeby testnet and copy paste your deployed contract to see if it is correctly deployed.

🚨 Go back to your .env file. Save your deployed contract address there, we will need it later.

Here is the direct opensea collection link.

Phew!!! We are 80% done. You should be proud of yourself. You started from scratch and now you have your own collection of NFT minted on testnet. I think you should talk about it on Twitter, LinkedIn, Discord. In short anywhere you can humble brag a bit and tell people that your are doing amazing stuff on Web3.

While you are at it, don’t forget to mention  [@Metaschool_](https://twitter.com/metaschool_)  on twitter. We need your support to reach more devs.
