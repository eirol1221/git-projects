# Building & Shipping

## **🦊 Introduction**

Heya folks! Today we will be doing this quick project to help you connect your metamask account to a react app.

MetaMask is the easiest way to connect to ethereum blockchain and sign transactions too. So if you are building a dapp or web3 project, there is a high chance, you will be using MetaMask or adding the functionality to connect as an account.  
  
I will quickly help you learn this.

As usual, we will be using node package manager for installing some stuff and VScode as our preferred app for creating the project. So, please install VScode and node on your machine. Install [node from here](https://nodejs.org/en/). Download [VScode](https://code.visualstudio.com/)  from here.

If you complete this course with me today, you will be getting a special NFT, a utility token, which will unlock many more opportunities for you on the Metaschool platform. Here is how the NFT looks like.

Now before we move forward, let’s set some house rules first.  ![](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/rpW6Nmm5Sl7UXSwsVUlNfRC3mfhib3FZ-GlvaMYsmZQ5ucwwu8RF8RRlYPye-wJVSjwGqKdxviy445hksdMQ26jjVZjYcQ8eqAMO2KeGadd2-FgtCS40FJjW3ifSsvqWfMYRIFN6)
